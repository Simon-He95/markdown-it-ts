This folder contains reference material for people extending `markdown-it-ts`.

If you are consuming the package and only need the runtime API, start with the
project [`README`](../README.md). The upstream markdown-it documentation remains
fully applicable for feature semantics, and we call out TypeScript-specific
gotchas or enhancements here when needed.
